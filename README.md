# RegionalPopulation

Population density map of one of the 49 states of the United States (other than California) for the latest year the data is available on US Census using D3-Data Driven Documents.

Along	the	x-axis	is GDP	in	Trillions	of	US	Dollars	.	Along	the	y-axis	is	EPC	(Energy	Consumption	per	Capita)	in	Million	BTUs	per	person. The	scatterplot	itself	is	a	(x,y)	placement	of	15 countries,	where	each	country	is	drawn	as	a	circle	with	area	proportional	to	total	(total	energy	consumption)	in	Trillion	BTUs obtained	by	multiplying	EPC	with Population.	All	the	data	pertains	to	the	year	2010.	

# Introduction to D3:

D3 = Data-Driven Documents D3 is a Javascript library for creating data visualizations. Data is provided by you, the user. Documents are web-based documents (HTML, SVG,â€¦) that can be rendered by a web browser. D3 does the driving by connecting data to documents. D3 is entirely open source and freely available at Github (https://github.com/mbostock/d3/)

D3 loads data into memory, binds data to elements within the document, transforms the visual properties of those elements based on data, and transitions elements based on user input.

# Download

Installers for the latest stable build for Mac, Windows and Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) can be downloaded at http://brackets.io/.

The Linux version has most of the features of the Mac and Windows versions, but is still missing a few things. See the Linux wiki page for a list of known issues and to find out how you can help.

# Installing Topojson
Topojson was updated by Mike Bostock to Geo2Topo.
* website: https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5562380 (California Population Density)

You need to install topojson by specifying the specific version by
"sudo npm install -g topojson@1.6.27"

# Usage

Chrome Browser (rather than Firefox or Internet Explorer or Safari or any other browser) is used.

By default, Brackets opens a folder containing some simple "Getting Started" content. You can choose a different folder to edit using File > Open Folder.

# To run the code:

When you launch Brackets, there is a Live preview button on the top right that looks like a ~. Clicking this button automatically launches Chrome Browser where you can instantly witness the results of the HTML, CSS, Javascript, or D3 code.
